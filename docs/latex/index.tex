{\ttfamily Bazel\+\_\+\+Vulkan\+\_\+\+Metal} is a personal Computer Graphics project I\textquotesingle{}m doing for learning {\ttfamily Vulkan}, {\ttfamily Metal}, {\ttfamily Bazel} and many other technical stuff that I want to learn like {\ttfamily Renderer Debuggers}, {\ttfamily protobuf}, {\ttfamily HLSL}, {\ttfamily Ruby}, ...
