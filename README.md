# Bazel_Vulkan_Metal | Bazel_VenomEngine

## Description

`Bazel_Vulkan_Metal` is a personal Computer Graphics project I'm doing for learning `Vulkan`, `Metal`, `Bazel` and many other technical stuff that I want to learn like `Renderer Debuggers`, `protobuf`, `HLSL`, ...

## Setup

I strongly recommend you to use CLion as your IDE for running this project as Bazel is better made for this IDE, especially for C++ projects as Google is directly maintaining it. 

### DirectX Shader Compiler

In order to compile the `HLSL` shaders present in this project to `SPIR-V`, you will need `DXC` or `DirectX Shader Compiler`, to compile it, first refer to the official `Prerequisites` documentation from their repository: https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/docs/BuildingAndTestingDXC.rst#prerequisites. 

You could just simply use the Makefile command:

```
make dxc
```

If you want to do it manually, then do this:

```powershell
mkdir cmake_build
cd cmake_build
# You can ignore the generator flag if you want to use the default one
cmake ../lib/DirectXShaderCompiler -G <Generator> -C ../lib/DirectXShaderCompiler/cmake/caches/PredefinedParams.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDXC_USE_LIT=On -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On -DLLVM_LIT_ARGS="-v"
cmake --build . --target dxc --config Release
```

## Compilation

### Shaders

We will basically follow this guideline:
- Guideline: https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/SPIR‚ÄêV-CodeGen
- Command Line Options: https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/docs/SPIR-V.rst#supported-command-line-options

You can either do this to compile every shader:

```
make compile_shader
```

Or do this manually:

```
# Example for vertex and fragment/pixel shader
## -T: shader profile, -Fo: output file, -spirv: output format
mkdir ./assets/shaders/compiled
./cmake_build/Release/bin/dxc -T vs_6_0 -spirv ./assets/shaders/hlsl/vertex_shader.hlsl -Fo ./assets/shaders/compiled/vertex_shader.spv
./cmake_build/Release/bin/dxc -T ps_6_0 -spirv ./assets/shaders/hlsl/pixel_shader.hlsl -Fo ./assets/shaders/compiled/fragment_shader.spv
```

Refer to this for Shader Profiles: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-models

### Project

#### Windows & MacOS

```bash
bazel build -c opt //:VenomEngine
bazel run //:VenomEngine
```

#### Linux

First, you will need to make sure you know which windowing system you are using (`X11` or `Wayland`).

The default setup for `VenomEngine` is based on `X11`, if you want to change it to `Wayland`, you will need to change some of the Bazel `BUILD` files in the project.

- `/lib/GLFW/BUILD`: comment every instance of `"-D_GLFW_X11"` and uncomment every instance of `"-D_GLFW_WAYLAND"`.
- `/lib/vulkan/BUILD`: comment every instance of `"-D_GLFW_X11"` and uncomment every instance of `"-D_GLFW_WAYLAND"`.

Then, you can compile and run the project with the following commands:


```bash
bazel build -c opt //:VenomEngine
bazel run //:VenomEngine
```

## Debugging

### Useful Links

- [Jetbrains Debugger Renderers](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/qt-tutorial.html#debug-renderers)

### Windows

- Do not forget to setup your default debugger as the one from Visual Studio (`lldb`) because MinGW is using `gdb` and the default settings aren't as helpful as Visual Studio brings a lot of `Debugger Renderers` (`.natvis` files).

### macOS
